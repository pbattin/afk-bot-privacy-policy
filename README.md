The AFK Bot team members are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that happens in your server.

Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information collected or received by AFK Bot through your use of the Service.

If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, please contact an admin on our Discord Server

Stored Data
AFK Bots uses user activity in a server. This meaning, it keeps track of the times users speak in the server and from this AFK Bot can extrapolate useful data from your server otherwise hidden to help boost activity, find the best times to promote events, or to utilize in activty based events. This is stored in a database where this data is used to give each member in your server an activity score and from all those combined to give you data about your server such as the most active times

Anonymous User Tracking Data
To analyze user behavior and generate data about your server, we store user data. users will have certain activity scores based on their activity times.  However, this data is limited. It only tells if a user was active, either by typing or joining a voice chat. However, it does not track or store what users are typing, or what channels they join.

The only time AFK Bot will read the content of the message is when checking for commands (soon to go away for slash commands) or if a server and user (both) have AFK DM messages enabled. Which are designed to identify and prevent ghost pings or as an alternative noticiations system for keeping track of messages. When both of these requirements are met, AFK Bot will DM an inactive member what someone said who tagged or responded to them in the server. AFK Bot does not log the content of the message, only forwards it to the inactive member.

Third-Party Tracking
There is no third party tracking
